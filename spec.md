### Objective:
	
Generates Vcards and QR codes from a list of employee details in a csv file.

### Usage:

The csv file must contain employee details in the following format:\
	last name, first name, designation, email, phone number.\
Eg: 'Alice','Bob','Software Engineer','alice@example.com','555-555-5555'

The next employee's detail must be written in the next row/line in the csv file.
	
	Script: python3 gen_vcards.py <csv_file>

Once the script is entered, each row in the csv file is parsed and a Vcard, QR code is generated for each employee.\
Each Vcard file will be of the format: lastname_firstname.vcf\
Each Qr file will be of the format: lastname_firstname.qr.png

### Output:

A new directory called 'vcards' will be created.\
This directory will contain all the Vcards and QR codes.
Note: If the directory 'vcards' already exists, an error will show up.
	
If a perticular row in the csv file contains the following employee details:\
	'Alice','Bob','Software Engineer','alice@example.com','555-555-5555'
	
Files named 'alice_bob.vcf' and 'alice_bob.qr.png' will be generated.\
The file 'alice_bob.vcf' will contain the following:
